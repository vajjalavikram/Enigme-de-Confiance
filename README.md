# E’nigme de Confiance

## Prologue
**Trust is an important factor for prosperity of any civilization. Again, of course it is the root of all evil. The strong do overpower the weak and civilization progresses with all exploiters, or wait, does it? Can ‘cooperation and understanding’ of the innocents, prevail over those who cheat?**

## What is this?
Enigme-de-Confiance, (french for *Evolution of Trust*) is a game based on the concept of prisoner's dilemma. Inspired from the famous game (with the same name) by Nicky Case, Enigme-de-Confiance tests the ability of players to use Mathematics and Statistics, and come up with predictions about which characters in the game will reign supreme in the race of evolution. The characters, each had a specific trait such as being truthful, cheating or being suspicious, which goverened how the got points.
